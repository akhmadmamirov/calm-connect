Confused by metrics and crisis access

Found the resource useful

Knew who to contact

Would possibly use daily due to the appealing aesthetics

Misleading arrow for dashboard metric

Selection by title/thumbnail

Potential for personalization is there

Would use in free moments for reflection

Would only post if anonymous

Supported moderators with slight concern for censorship

Didn’t connect with the current topics

Could become smarter with user history

Personalization could support continued usage

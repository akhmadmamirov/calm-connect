Homepage Impressions

Liked the dashboard chart and greeting

Thought layout and hierarchy were well balanced

Unsure of app purpose from homepage

Found dashboard metric and mood average confusing

Didn’t know where to go for crisis support (hidden in profile)

Task Scenario 1: Finding Crisis Resources

Found resources after exploring tabs

Resources matched expectations and were clear

Knew who to contact first

Scenario 2: Mood Tracking

Mood description was easy via buttons

Would use daily with some changes

Suggested a calendar for upcoming events

Scenario 3: Guided Meditation

Would choose based on title/thumbnail

Feels it could be personalized with improvements

Would consider using between classes

Scenario 4: Community Forum

Would post only if anonymous

Likes idea of moderators but concerned about censorship

Didn’t find topics relevant

Scenario 5: Personalized Suggestions

App could feel smarter with modifications

Personalized suggestions could help with engagement

Wrap-Up

Favorite: Mood tracker and dashboard greeting

Change request: Add calendar view for events

Homepage Impressions

Said homepage looked like a self-care website

Liked dashboard greeting and visual balance

Didn’t know app purpose from homepage

Found dashboard metrics unclear, crisis support hard to locate

Task Scenario 1: Finding Crisis Resources

Couldn’t recall how she found the resources

Thought they were appropriate

Would know who to reach out to

Scenario 2: Mood Tracking

Easy to use

Would use daily with changes

Wanted more than 3 mood options

Scenario 3: Guided Meditation

Would choose based on title/thumbnail

Could be more personalized

Would use for mood check-ins or journaling

Scenario 4: Community Forum

Would only post anonymously

Moderators are helpful but could limit openness

Topics not personally relevant

Scenario 5: Personalized Suggestions

App has potential to learn preferences

Custom suggestions could help maintain interest

Wrap-Up

Favorite: Greeting and mood dashboard

Change request: Expand mood options beyond 3

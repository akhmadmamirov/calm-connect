Homepage Impressions

Liked dashboard visuals and greeting

Liked structure and visual hierarchy

Unclear about app’s purpose

Confused by dashboard metrics and mood average

Didn’t know where to go for crisis help

Task Scenario 1: Finding Crisis Resources

Found it after first platform scan

Resources were what he expected

Clear on who to contact first

Scenario 2: Mood Tracking

Easy to log mood

Doesn’t usually use non-essential apps, but might with fixes

Found dashboard metric confusing

Scenario 3: Guided Meditation

Would choose by title/thumbnail

Feels it could be more personalized

Might use journaling/mood indication in downtime

Scenario 4: Community Forum

Concerned about reach: wants to know if posts are public or private

Likes moderators but fears censorship

Topics not relevant

Scenario 5: Personalized Suggestions

Potential is there with enhancements

Could help retain engagement

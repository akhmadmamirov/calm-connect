Based on the participant’s Backgrounds
* None regularly use wellness apps (except Balti, who used Headspace).
* None use campus mental health services or online support forums.
* All were unfamiliar with CalmConnect before testing.

Key Findings & User Sentiments
* First Impressions: Positive response to dashboard layout and greeting message. Layout felt balanced and inviting.
* Main Point of Confusion: Unclear app purpose from homepage. Users didn’t immediately know what the app was for.
* Crisis Resources: Poorly located in the user profile; none could find it when prompted in-the-moment.
* Mood Tracker: Well-liked, easy to use, but limited in emotional range.
* Community Forum: Mixed willingness to engage; anonymity and moderation policies unclear.
* Personalization: Felt underdeveloped; potential seen with improvements.

Prioritized List of Usability Issues
 
🔴 1. Crisis Resource Invisibility (Critical – High Frequency, High Severity)

Issue: Users could not find crisis help during high-stress tasks. It was buried in the user profile, not visible from the homepage. 
  
  Resolution Plan:
* Relocate the crisis help button to the top-left of the homepage in persistent whitespace
* Use a red or high-contrast icon to signify urgency

🟠 2. Unclear Homepage Purpose (High Frequency, Moderate Severity)

Issue: None of the users could identify what the app was for from the homepage alone. 
  
  Resolution Plan:
* Branding


🟠 3. Confusing Dashboard Metrics (Moderate Frequency, Moderate Severity)

Issue: Several users were confused by how the dashboard metrics, especially mood averages, were calculated and presented. 
  
  Resolution Plan:
* Use simpler language or visual cues to show what the dashboard is tracking

🟡 4. Limited Mood Tracking Options (Low Frequency, Moderate Severity)

Issue: Some users (Habibe in particular) felt that three moods were too limiting. 
  
  Resolution Plan:
* Add more mood options or allow custom entries

🟡 5. Misleading Navigation Icons (Low Frequency, Low Severity)

Issue: Saleh noted arrow indicators implied deeper navigation when none existed. 
  
  Resolution Plan:
* Replace or remove misleading arrows
* Ensure navigation indicators are only used when content expands

🟢 6. Community Forum Anonymity Unclear (High Frequency, Low Severity)

Issue: Tasin, Saleh, Habibe, and Faiaz were unsure if posts were anonymous or visible to everyone. 
  
  Resolution Plan:
* Include a clear notice explaining visibility settings before posting

Next Steps
* Begin with the critical fix: moving and redesigning the crisis resource location
* Add branding
* Iterate on dashboard metric clarity and mood options in the next sprint
* Conduct a follow-up usability test post-fixes to validate effectiveness
